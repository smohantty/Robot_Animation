I want you to create a one page html canvas which supports 3d rendering . which will render a Lamp robot same as pixar lamp robot .
Robot has 3 property that can be animated . the head can be rotated and tilt.
the lamp brightness can be changed from 0 to 100%.

The lamp should able to animate those properties based on the robot_animation_schema.json in this current folder .
The robot shoudl animate using the robot_animation_example.json file
